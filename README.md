# CS_370_Module_8

# Brief Explanation

## This project was about Deep Q-Learning and the process of getting an agent to systematically and strategically go through a maze to receive a reward (treasure). For this project, we were provided with a majority of the code that made the game function but it was our task to create the code for the intelligent agent that needed to navigate through the course to find the treasure. The TreasureMaze.py file, which was provided, set the landscape for the game and what the agent would essentially need to navigate through. The GameExperience.py file, which was also provided, set up the structure of the game for a reward and penalty system.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

## Computer scientists design and develop algorithms, software, and systems to solve complex problems and improve efficiency across various domains. Their work drives innovation in technology, impacting everything from everyday conveniences to groundbreaking advances in fields like medicine, finance, and communication.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

## To approach a problem as a computer scientist, I start by clearly defining the problem and breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts. Then, analyze possible solutions, design and implement algorithms or systems, and iteratively test and refine my approach to ensure it effectively addresses the issue.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

## As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities to the end user includes ensuring their privacy, security, and informed consent, while avoiding bias and ensuring accessibility. To the organization, I should adhere to professional integrity, transparency, and compliance with legal and ethical standards, while contributing to the organization's goals and maintaining confidentiality.
